In April 1191 Richard left Messina for Acre, but a storm dispersed his large fleet.[75] After some searching, it was discovered that the ship carrying his sister Joan and his new fiancée, Berengaria of Navarre, was anchored on the south coast of Cyprus, along with the wrecks of several other vessels, including the treasure ship. Survivors of the wrecks had been taken prisoner by the island's ruler, Isaac Komnenos.[76]

On 1 May 1191 Richard's fleet arrived in the port of Lemesos on Cyprus.[76] He ordered Isaac to release the prisoners and treasure.[76] Isaac refused, so Richard landed his troops and took Limassol.[77] Various princes of the Holy Land arrived in Limassol at the same time, in particular Guy of Lusignan. All declared their support for Richard provided that he support Guy against his rival, Conrad of Montferrat.[78]

The local magnates abandoned Isaac, who considered making peace with Richard, joining him on the crusade, and offering his daughter in marriage to the person named by Richard.[79] Isaac changed his mind, however, and tried to escape. Richard's troops, led by Guy de Lusignan, conquered the whole island by 1 June. Isaac surrendered and was confined with silver chains because Richard had promised that he would not place him in irons. Richard named Richard de Camville and Robert of Thornham as governors. He later sold the island to the master of Knights Templar, Robert de Sablé, and it was subsequently acquired, in 1192, by Guy of Lusignan and became a stable feudal kingdom.[80]

The rapid conquest of the island by Richard was of strategic importance. The island occupies a key strategic position on the maritime lanes to the Holy Land, whose occupation by the Christians could not continue without support from the sea.[80] Cyprus remained a Christian stronghold until the battle of Lepanto (1571).[81] Richard's exploit was well publicised and contributed to his reputation, and he also derived significant financial gains from the conquest of the island.[81] Richard left Cyprus for Acre on 5 June with his allies.
